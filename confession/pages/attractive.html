<h1 id="text">A Short Poem for the Girl I admire the most</h1>
<h3>"She..."</h3>
<h4>When I saw you for the first time wearing that dress,</h4>
<h4>I started to feel relief and forget all the stress.</h4>
<h4>It was all so sudden, it felt like a dream,</h4>
<h4>I wanted to jump, I wanted to scream.</h4>
<h4>I was so happy, like never before,</h4>
<h4>I wasn't sad like I was, anymore.</h4>
<h4>Instead I was happier, than ever,</h4>
<h4>I know we'll meet, in Assemblies sooner or later.</h4>
<h4>I or we just need to be patient, and wait for that day,</h4>
<h4>And when we get together, everything will be Okay.</h4>
<h4>So I'll wait for you, even if it takes ages,</h4>
<h4>Then We can go laugh at memories, as we together turn the pages.</h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4></h4>
